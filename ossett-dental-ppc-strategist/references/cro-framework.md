# Landing Page System — CRO Framework

## Core Philosophy

Landing pages must:
1. Match the ad message exactly (headline-to-headline)
2. Load instantly on mobile (<2 seconds)
3. Show the £49 offer above the fold
4. Display trust signals clearly
5. Minimise friction
6. Capture leads through one clear CTA
