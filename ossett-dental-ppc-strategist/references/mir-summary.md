## Messaging Hierarchy

| Pillar | Type | Execution |
|--------|------|-----------|
| Hygiene-Led Model | Primary USP | "Where oral health begins with your hygienist, not ends with them" |
| £49 New Patient Exam | Objection Handling | "Private dental care at realistic prices—new patient exams from £49" |

- Displaying £49 price point immediately
- Explaining prevention is cheaper than cure

## Geographic Targeting

### Tier 2 (Standard): 5–10 miles toward Wakefield (WF1, WF2, WF4)
